    """
    Return a dictionary mapping command names to their callback applications.

    Look for a management.commands package in django.core, and in each
    installed application -- if a commands package exists, register all
    commands in that package.

    Core commands are always included. If a settings module has been
    specified, also include user-defined commands.

    The dictionary is in the format {command_name: app_name}. Key-value
    pairs from this dictionary can then be used in calls to
    load_command_class(app_name, command_name)

    If a specific version of a command must be loaded (e.g., with the
    startapp command), the instantiated module can be placed in the
    dictionary in place of the application name.

    The dictionary is cached on the first call and reused on subsequent
    calls.
